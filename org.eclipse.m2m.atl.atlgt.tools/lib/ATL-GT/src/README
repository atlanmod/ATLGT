This directory includes OCaml source of commands 
built on top of GRoundTram distribution.
GRoundTram (0.9.5 release candidate) source has been downloaded by

 $ pushd ../..
 $ wget -nd http://www.biglab.org/src/ground_tram-0.9.5-rc.tgz
 $ gzip -cd ground_tram-0.9.5-rc.tgz | tar xvf -
 $ popd

We also enclose XML-Light whose source has been downloaded and unpacked by
 $ wget -nd http://tech.motion-twin.com/zip/xml-light-2.2.zip
 $ unzip xml-light-2.2.zip

* PREREQUISITES
  Same as those for GRoundTram. See ../../ground_tram-0.9.5/INSTALL.
  MONA is only necessary for static typechecking (chkuncal) of transformations.

* INSTALL

 1. Make GRoundTram commands and libraries

   $ pushd ../../ground_tram-0.9.5
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ popd

 2. Make XML-Light libraries

   $ pushd xml-light
   $ make opt
   $ popd

   These are necessary only once.

 3. Make ATL-GRoundTram integration commands

   $ make

   The following programs will be produced:

  - atl2unql  (ATL to UnQL translator)
  - xmi2dot_generic_command (XMI to DOT converter)
  - dot2xmi_command (DOT to XMI converter)

  The following commands are not used
  - fixdot
  - dot2dgm_command (object diagram visualizer for DOT file encoding models)

 4. Stand-alone test a sample (Optional)
 
 4.1 Forward transformation

  $ make Makefile.test fwd
  
 4.2 Edit target XMI file with any text editor
 
  $ vi ClassDiagram2Relational-target.xmi
  
  Note that only in-place update on singleton of primitive data type attributes
  are currently supported for demonstration.

 4.3 Backward transformation

  $ make Makefile.test bwd

  New source XMI file Sample-ClassDiagram_UPD.xmi is generated as the result of 
  backward transformation.

* Acknowledgment

 We thank Dr. Isao Sasano for jointly working with an earlier version of 
 ATL to UnQL and XMI to DOT translater.
