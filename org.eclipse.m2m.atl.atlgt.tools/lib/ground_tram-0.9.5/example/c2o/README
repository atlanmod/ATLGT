The tutorial in the directory doc explains all the files in details.

(1) Database

- Customer.km3: the customer schema
- customers_c.uncal: a customer graph
- Order.km3: the order schema

(2) Transformation

- c2o_c.unql: an unQL+ query program

(3) Generated files

- customers_c.dot, customers_c.png: 
  the customer graph in the DOT and the PNG formats

- customers_c_mod.dot, customers_c_mod.png, customers_c_mod.uncal: 
  a modified customer graph in different formats

- orders_c.dot, orders_c.png, orders_c.uncal: 
  the generated order graph

- orders_c.xg, orders_c.ei: 
  two generated files from the forward computation for later backward
  computation. These two files are omitted in the distribution and can
  be created with the following command:
  > make forward_uncal

- orders_c_trace.dot: 
  the generated order graph with trace information

- orders_c_trace.xg orders_c_trace.ei: 
  two generated files from the forward computation for later backward
  computation. These two files are omitted in the distribution and can
  be created with the following command:
  > make forward_uncal_trace

(4) Axillary files

- orders_c_mod.dot: users' modification of orders_c.dot
- Makefile: a set of commands for simple testing

(5) Obsolete Files (old implementation)

 - c2o.unql
 - customers.uncal
